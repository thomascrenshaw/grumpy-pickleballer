  <h1>About the “Grumpy” Pickleballer</h1>
  <p>
    I am a late-50s, late-blooming pickleball player who somehow decided that
    learning a new sport, a new paddle, and a new kitchen all at once was a good idea.
  </p>
  <p>
    The “grumpy” in Grumpy Pickleballer is mostly a joke. I am not actually mad at
    the sport. I am occasionally mad at my own footwork, my split-step timing, and
    the ball that clips the net cord and drops just out of reach.
  </p>
  <p>
    This site is my field journal: short posts, photos from the courts, small gear
    experiments, and the inner monologue of a guy who believes pickleball should be
    fun first, humble always, and just serious enough that we keep showing up.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we ever end up on the same court, say hi. I will probably overshare about
    paddles, dinks, and why the kitchen is the best part of the game.
