If you are going to start a pickleball blog called "Grumpy Pickleballer," you
might as well collect some reviews.

So far, my favorites are:

- "I only have one problem with the way you play — you've got potential, kid."
  — Will  
- "Have you played racquet sports before?"  
  "About 30 years ago."  
  "Hmm. Okay." — Instructor Matt

I am choosing to treat both as glowing endorsements of a late-blooming rookie
season.
