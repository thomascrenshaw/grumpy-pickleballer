There is a very specific kind of silence right before a first serve.

In my head, it is the sound of every PE class, every coach whistle, and every
"don’t screw this up" memory I have ever collected.

On the court, it is just me, a plastic ball, and three other people who mostly
just want to have fun and maybe hit one cool shot before they go home.

Turns out, when I remember that second part, the serve gets a lot easier.
