blurb: I came for the banging drives. I stayed for the soft hands and petty little dinks at the net.

When I first heard there was something called "the kitchen," I assumed it was
where I would be told not to go.

Now it is my favorite place on the court.

There is something deeply satisfying about a rally where nobody is swinging
hard. Just little pushes, rolls, and tiny acts of controlled chaos over the net.

It is like playing catch with gravity and patience at the same time.
