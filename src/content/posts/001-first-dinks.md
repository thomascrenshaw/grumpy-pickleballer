blurb: I came for chaos and cardio. I stayed for the weird joy of barely getting the ball over the net on purpose.

Today I had one of those sessions where my brain and my feet were clearly running
different operating systems.

The good news: I finally had a few dinks that were _actually_ intentional and not
just "I was late and the ball happened to clear the net." The bad news: my inner
monologue still sounds like a grumpy coach who cares way too much about third
shots for a dude who is only a few weeks into the sport.

The truth is somewhere in the middle.

I am playing, I am sweating, I am laughing with people I did not know a month ago,
and every time the ball does something unexpected I get a free physics lesson.

If that is what being a "grumpy pickleballer" looks like, I think I am okay with it.
